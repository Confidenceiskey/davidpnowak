### [Local Weather App Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

_This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org), which helps you to learn how to code through online courses, projects and also provides interview preparation._


#### Project Guidelines
The aim for this project was to build a web app that shows the user their local weather. FreeCodeCamp allowed us to use whichever libraries or APIs that we required to solve this challenge. The design and UI was up to us to create.  
To complete the project, the below **user stories** needed to be fulfilled:
- I can see the weather in my current location
- There is a weather icon, or background image, showing what the weather is like in more detail (Example: sunny, snowy, rain ..etc)
- I can click on a button to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius 

_My own extra requirement:_ 
_- The background colour changes (similar to a heat map) depending on the user's current weather temperature._


#### Project Approach

For this project, I had to use an API to obtain the weather data, and I opted to use the freeCodeCamp one that was made for this challenge.

I first started by designing the UI and got it to work with HTML and CSS. Once I completed that, I started adding functionality (one-by-one) with JavaScript and JQuery. I connected to the API, to get the weather data to be displayed on the screen. Next I would add the button to convert between _fahrenheit_ and _celsius_. I added the CSS graphics to be displayed, depending on what result came from the user's location. Lastly I made the background color change depending on the temperature that was returned. I also verified that everything worked properly, including on various screen sizes.
